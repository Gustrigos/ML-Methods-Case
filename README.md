# ML-Methods-Case
The following are a set of Jupyter Notebooks solutions for the regression and classification final case study in my class of Machine Learning - DAT-5303.

Each of the case studies had strict requirements based on high model performance, bias/ variance tradeoff, model run-time, libraries to use, etc.
